AI-Powered Resume Parser and Job Matcher


Project Overview->
This project implements a robust, scalable, and intelligent system for parsing resumes from various formats and calculating a semantic match score against job descriptions using state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) and NLP techniques (Hugging Face Transformers).
The solution is built on a modern microservice architecture designed for high throughput and reliability.

Architecture->
The system is composed of four containerized services orchestrated by Docker Compose:
api (FastAPI): Handles all client requests, authentication, file validation, and queues parsing jobs.
worker (Celery): The decoupled processing engine. It executes the time-consuming tasks (Text Extraction, AI Parsing, Matching).

db (PostgreSQL): Persistent storage for parsed resume data (using JSONB for flexible schema).

redis: Used as the message broker for Celery, enabling asynchronous task queuing.

🚀 Setup and Installation

Prerequisites

Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine)

Docker Compose

One-Command Setup

Navigate to the project root directory and execute the setup script:

chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

The script will automatically clean up, build the required Docker images (be patient, the initial build takes time to install PyTorch/Transformers), start the four services, and run the database table creation.

📋 Core Endpoints

The API documentation is fully compliant with OpenAPI and available via Swagger UI.

Method

Endpoint

Description

GET

/health

API service status check.

POST

/resumes/upload

Uploads a file (PDF/DOCX/TXT/Image), saves it, and queues the parsing job.

GET

/resumes/{id}

Retrieves the full structured JSON data of a parsed resume.

GET

/resumes/{id}/status

Checks the status of a parsing job (processing or completed).

POST

/resumes/{id}/match

(Advanced) Calculates a semantic match score against a provided Job Description JSON.

AI/ML Implementation Details

Data Extraction (Core)

Technique: Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline from Hugging Face Transformers (dslim/bert-base-NER).

Purpose: Converts raw text into structured fields (Name, Title, Skills, Education).

Resume-Job Matching (Advanced)

Technique: Sentence Embedding and Cosine Similarity.

Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (Sentence Transformer).

Logic: Converts resume text and job description text into numerical vectors and calculates semantic closeness for the overallScore.
